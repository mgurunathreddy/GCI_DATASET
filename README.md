# GCI_DATASET

This is a repository for CMU_ARCTIC dataset [1] GCI ground truth. This repository consits of manually marked GCI loactions (markers are in seconds) for randomly 
choosen 100 utternaces from each SLT, BDL, JMK dataset. The differenced EGG (dEGG) is taken as reference signal after compensating delay
between EGG and speech signal to mark GCI locations. All speech signals are downsampled to 16KHz, switched to negative polarity prior to
annotation.
